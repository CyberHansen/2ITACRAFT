## 📜 Description

2ITACRAFT is not your average Minecraft resource pack.  
It's an *experience* you never asked for but won't be able to forget.  
We've taken Minecraft's wholesome charm and replaced it with pure, chaotic energy.

- **Textures?** Cursed.  
- **Sounds?** Even worse.  
- **Music?** Let's just say you'll *hear* the difference.  

If you thought you were safe from weirdness in a block game, think again.

## ✨ Features

- 🖌 **Cursed Textures** – Every block and item has been given the "2ITA touch" (interpret that however you want).
- 🔊 **Distorted Sounds** – Doors, mobs, tools… nothing sounds normal anymore.
- 🎶 **Music Overhaul** – In-game music replaced with questionable choices.
- 🐔 **Unholy Mobs** – Chicken noises may never be the same.
